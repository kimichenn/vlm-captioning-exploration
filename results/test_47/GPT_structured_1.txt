{"environment_style":"The environment has a retro NES-style appearance, with pixelated graphics, limited color palette, and simplistic designs, aiming for an engaging and challenging platformer atmosphere.","environment_layout":"There are brick-like walls forming the boundaries of the level. Platforms span across open spaces, and a fireball hazard hovers between them. The bottom of the screen contains a region of red, presumably lava, as a destructive element. The playable character is positioned near or above the lava.","environment_dynamics":"The fireball moves laterally between the platforms repeatedly as an obstacle. The character is in motion, possibly jumping away from danger or targeting the platforms.","character_environment_interactions":"The primary character interacts with gravity and aims to avoid landing in lava or being hit by the fireball while attempting to navigate between the platforms."}
